Refunds
=======
A *refund* allows an amount to be returned to your customer. The refunded amount will be deducted from your Mollie
account balance.

Refunds for regular payment integrations are created using the :doc:`Refunds API </reference/v2/refunds-api/overview>`.

To create refunds for order-based integrations, refer to the
:doc:`Create order refund endpoint </reference/v2/refunds-api/create-order-refund>` instead.

Next to the API endpoint, you can also `create refunds manually
<https://help.mollie.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000014489-How-do-I-refund-a-payment-to-one-of-my-consumers->`_ via the
Mollie Dashboard.

Most payment methods support refunds. Refunds are not available for some payment methods like paysafecard
and gift cards.

Refunds support descriptions. We will show the given description in your Mollie Dashboard, in your exports, and we
will pass it along to your customer's bank or card issuer if possible.

.. _refund-statuses:

Refund statuses
---------------
Refunds have their own status, independent of the Payment or Order they were created for.

*queued*
  The refund is queued due to a lack of balance. Once your account has sufficient balance or you manually top up
  your balance, the refund automatically transitions to the next status. A queued refund can be canceled.

*pending*
  The refund is ready to be sent to the bank. You can still cancel the refund if you like.

*processing*
  The refund is being processed. Cancelation is no longer possible.

*refunded*
  The refund has been completed and your customer has either received the funds or the funds are on their way.

*failed*
  The refund has failed after processing. For example, the customer has closed his / her bank account. The funds will
  be returned to your account.

*canceled*
  The refund was canceled and will no longer be processed.

Insufficient balance
--------------------
If you have insufficient balance with Mollie to perform the refund, the refund will be queued until sufficient balance
is available again. We will automatically process the refund once your balance increases.

Additionally, you can also manually top up your balance via the `Administration page
<https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/administration>`_ in the Mollie Dashboard.

Partial refunds
----------------------------------
Partial refunds are fully supported. You can create multiple partial refunds if needed. Note that we will prevent
duplicate refunds in a short time frame.

Possible errors
---------------
Sometimes a situation can occur in which it is not possible to perform the refund. In such cases an HTTP ``4xx`` error
will be returned. Some of these situations are illustrated here:

* There might not be enough balance on your account with the payment provider (e.g. PayPal).
* Your Refund is a duplicate (of the same amount in the last hour) of another Refund on the Payment.
* You may have forgotten to grant the appropriate rights to Mollie for the payment provider (PayPal only).
* It is possible that the payment has already been (partially) refunded.

If you perform many refunds in parallel, you may get an HTTP ``503 Service unavailable`` error. In this case, you can be
certain the refund was not performed and you can safely retry the refund.

If there is a connection issue during the creation of a refund (e.g. a client-side time out is triggered) you should
**not retry automatically** as you cannot be sure the refund has been performed or not. In this case we suggest logging
into the Mollie Dashboard, or retrieving the payment's refunds via the API to validate if the refund has been created.
